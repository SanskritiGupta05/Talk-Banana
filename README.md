# Talk Banana ðŸ’›

a simple JS web app which can convert `text` into random `Minion Gibberish`.

API used = [Minion API](https://funtranslations.com/api/minion)

more fun Gibberish APIs can be found on : [https://funtranslations.com/](https://funtranslations.com/)

## TRY IT?

* Enter the `text` you want to get translated in banana language in the `first text box`.
for example:    
    ```
    Hello, i am your_name!

    ```

* Click on the `click here` button to get the output. 

* And Voila! the text has been translated into banana language. <br>the output will be,

    ```
    Bello, ka am your_name!

    ```
